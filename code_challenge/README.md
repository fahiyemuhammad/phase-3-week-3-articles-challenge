This project simulates the relationships between **Authors**, **Articles**, and **Magazines** using **Python** and **SQLite** with raw SQL queries. It includes full CRUD functionality, relationship methods, and a structured, testable codebase.

## Description

In this challenge, you'll work with three main entities:

- **Author**: A writer who can write many articles.
- **Article**: A piece written by an author and published in a magazine.
- **Magazine**: A publication that contains many articles from various authors.

Youâ€™ll use raw SQL to manage these relationships through Python model classes and a SQLite database.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3
- Raw SQL Queries
- `pytest` for testing

---

## Deliverables

- `Author` class:

  - `name` property
  - `articles()` method
  - `magazines()` method
  - `add_article(magazine, title)` method
  - `topic_areas()` method

- `Article` class:

  - `title`, `author_id`, `magazine_id` fields
  - `author()` and `magazine()` methods

- `Magazine` class:
  - `name`, `category` properties
  - `articles()` and `contributors()` methods
  - `article_titles()` method
  - `contributing_authors()` method (only authors with >2 articles)

## Running Tests

Make sure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
To run all tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest
ðŸ’¾ Seeding the Database
Use the seed.py script to populate your database with initial data:

bash
Copy
Edit
python seed.py
ðŸ”§ Setup & Installation
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/fahiyemuhammad/articles-code-challenge.git
cd articles-code-challenge
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the seed file to initialize the database:

bash
Copy
Edit
python seed.py
Start exploring the models or running tests!

 Notes
All SQL operations are performed through raw queries â€” no ORM (like SQLAlchemy) is used.

Code is modular, testable, and follows Python best practices.
